## Origin

Around 1550 BC, Ancient Egyptians used to diagnose diabetes by having the patient urinate on a stick. 

It was left out overnight to see if the increased glucose in the urine would attract ants. 

This was often enough to diagnose the patient with diabetes. This was a death sentence. 

The patient would soon enter a coma, then eventual death, within a very short time frame.

Thankfully, tech has come a long way since the time of the Egyptians. 

Currently, one of the main pieces of tech used by diabetics is a **CGM**. 

###### CGMs are BlueTooth transceivers that read and record glucose values every 5 minutes:

Sadly, there isn't much support for diabetics regarding staying on top of habits at a glance.

One of the main metrics that most diabetics w/ CGMs try to meet is keeping 70% of their daily reading within their high and low range.

###### Just an average reading isn't good enough:

A patient that's constantly either low or high may have a similar average to a patient that's constantly in range. However, the second patient's glucose control is better managed.

## Solution

We wanted to make a mobile application that allows the user to pull their CGM data and gamify the patients good habits. 

## Tech Stack

Swift and Firebase
